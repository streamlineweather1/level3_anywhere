## Introducing Level3_Anywhere

The level3_anywhere software package provides a python-based application to convert level3 radar products from an original RPG radar site to any other valid RPG radar site.<br><br>

This application is designed to allow for a more robust case study archive for training of meteorologists within software that decodes level3 radar data, such as the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). With level3_anywhere, any past significant weather event from anywhere within the NEXRAD network can be remapped and displayed to the radar and corresponding geographic region of the user's choosing.<br><br>

Below we see a screenshot of data from the KBMX radar (NWS Birmingham, AL) from April 11th, 2011 remapped to the KTBW radar (NWS Tampa Bay Area). In this instance, the Tuscaloosa EF-4 tornado event is now impacting the coastline of Pinelles County, Florida.<br><br>
